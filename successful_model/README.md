# Working Model
These are models that exhibit behaviors that accomplishes the training goals, though some of them may generate strange behaviors

## 1 vs 1 Scenario
1. The "defender_actor_2000.h5" model generates intercept behaviors, but the defender does not approach the attacher actively, instead it "waits" on the route of attacker's movement until the naive attacker comes into its tackling range.
